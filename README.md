### 🧠 Overview
**UniCalib** introduces a probabilistic framework for *targetless LiDAR–camera calibration* by unifying both modalities into dense depth representations.  
We model the calibration problem as **probabilistic flow estimation** in the unified depth space, incorporating flow uncertainty and a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to achieve robust cross-sensor alignment.

### 🌟 Key Highlights
- **Probabilistic depth flow** reframing 2D–3D correspondence for targetless calibration.  
- **Unified depth representation** bridging LiDAR and camera via a shared encoder.  
- **Reliability-aware modeling** with the novel **PWSF loss** for robust optimization.  
- **Strong generalization** with accurate results across diverse datasets.
